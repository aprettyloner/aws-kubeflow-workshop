# Machine Learning using [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org/)

[Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org) provides a simple, portable, and scalable way of running Machine Learning workloads on Kubernetes.

In this module, we will install Kubeflow on Amazon EKS, run a single-node training and inference using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/), train and deploy model locally and remotely using Fairing, setup Kubeflow pipeline and review how to call AWS managed services such as Sagemaker for training and inference.
